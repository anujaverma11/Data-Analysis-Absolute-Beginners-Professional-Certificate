#### Business Visualizations
Businesses live and breath by communicating data visualizations all the time. Here at Microsoft not a day goes by without various reports, scorecards, and charts flying through email and presentations to communicate business status and other information. In this lesson you'll start to see how to create these visualizations for business use.

#### Overview of Business Visualizations
You may see visualizations around you for personal use like health monitoring or the current status of your car, or the location of your train. Visualizations in a business context can be extremely useful in communicating complex information in simple and efficient ways. In this lesson we're going to look at the importance of visualizations in business, and a few simple ways they are used.


When we do visualization of business there are really four artifacts that we end up creating as data visualization experts. 
1. Dashboards. And when you think of dashboards you may immediately go to maybe the dashboard in your car. And that's to show you an aggregate of information like is my car healthy? How fast am I going? And how many miles do I have left in my tank of gas? And all that stuff can be accessed in that one portal, and that's the idea of dashboards is that you can run your business out of a dashboard. 
Dashboard - Dashboards are used to track performance, a dashboard is a compilation of various visualizations to summarize business information. They are usually specific to a parituclar role-based audience, they are sometimes interactive using filters, and there are always multiple visualizations related to each other in the same dashboard.


2. Scorecards is maybe even more specific to performance. For these key metrics, how am I doing? Red, yellow, green? Is there something I need to be aware of right now? Something flashing at me? There's a lot's of different ways that you can scorecard, but it's all to do with performance. And those are used to track things like in business, your revenue targets your customer satisfaction, and all that. And I think can be used inside of a dashboard.
Scorecard - Scorecards are specific visualizations to display performance. They track things like revenue targets of customer satisfaction - any thing that can be specifically measured against a target. Scorecards are often presented as one part of a dashboard. Scorecards often illustrate KPIs (key performance indicators).


3. Next, maybe in less complex scenarios you basically do an <b> analytic </b>  report. And the idea is that you create this report as visualization that business users will access maybe more than once and it refreshes with live data, but it doesn't have to be this one stop shop of everything happening in the business. 
Analytic Reports - Analytic reports are pre-designed analytic views based on data. These can be basic or complex charts, and can be refreshed against the latest data to provide a current timely report.


4. And last but not least for sure, are just basic analysis. When you're creating an analysis for a problem at hand, and that might be a one-off and that's okay, and that's necessary for the thing that you're working on. And that might be, let's figure out how we're doing on sales today, or in other example in business, let's figure out where our customer's pain points are and then from that analysis we could then take some specific action in our business to change behavior to drive results.
Analysis - This is free-form reporting that could be a one-time use report or group of charts used to answer a particular business question.

#### Analysis
When doing Analysis you're working with a specific problem at hand. Maybe it's a one off report or a one off chart that you're making and you're trying to solve something.

#### Reporting
Unlike our basic analysis where we were looking at a specific problem, reports are kind of made to be a little bit more of an aggregation or a summary of things happening. It's not necessarily something that's hyper interactive or has a lot of intelligence built into it. It's just a summary of an aggregation of your data.

#### Scorecarding
The idea is as you tack on some more intelligence, and bake that into the report itself, and make it an indication of performance rather than just a report, you're entering the Scorecard territory. And in this, you also see these red, yellow, green stoplights, you see trend lines, and there's just more built into it.

And the components of a Scorecard are not too much more complicated than just a basic report.
But the idea is you have these metrics or what are called KPI's, Key Performance Indicators, that form the basis of this chart.
And so you have your metric values, and you have your trend perhaps on that side, that's a nice addition, but it's not necessary.
And just provide some more ability to interact and understand how things are going. And you have your details, and the performance indicators maybe the most important part of the Scorecard. You have your stoplight. Are we going well, or are things going well?
Do we have to stop and slow down? Do we have to accelerate? And that's the idea of these. And this is imperfect, right?
So, there's a few other things that you want like scale. What's a scale of goodness? How are those thresholds determined?
Where is your legend? And all these things like even a title would be helpful to put in here, but that's a given, you already know that.
So this is what a Scorecard is. And I think the biggest part is just understand that it's about performance and how things are going,
and indicating that and you got the basics.

##### Key Performance Indicators
A common item on a scorecard is a KPI or Key Performance Indicator. These are specific pieces of data that have defined ranges for success. They're useful to provide an at-a-glance measure of the health of a paricular measurement. A scorecard full of KPIs that uses a known color scheme, like red means bad and green means good, can make it very easy to determine the business health at a point in time.

You can specify the ranges and which color indicators should be used in Microsoft Excel using Icon Sets under the Conditional Formatting option.

In this example, there is a KPI column showing business health at a glance - it's a visual indication for each row to see if the business is on target, or not.

>> Moving from analysis, to reports,
to a scorecards, maybe
the most complex that we can build,
the artifacts that we make for businesses are dashboards.
This one stop shop like we mentioned.
And then this is an industry analysis dashboard.
And there's a whole lot going on,
but you can imagine that, perhaps,
somebody who's trying to do some competitive analysis,
who has a responsibility in a business,
already has some context in play.
And this dashboard is made for her or him,
and they would sit down and look at this and
understand where things at in
their business. Where are things going?
Where are things wrong that I need to pay attention to
or is everything okay and I can
go back to my work at hand?
And that's really the purpose of dashboards.
And in this case,
there's a whole lot going on in this one.
There's over eight charts.
And is it a scorecard?
Is it a dashboard or a port?
I think that in the end,
the scorecards or reports can form part of a dashboard.
And in this case, it's lacking something,
perhaps, like a title and some more context.
The lines can get blurry,
but the idea is if you keep these kind of four things in
your mind, you have analyses,
you have reports, scorecards,
and you have dashboards,
you can at least distinguish
what am I being asked to create?
Is it something more like
the dashboard I saw before or it's
just for a specific person or is it for our business?
Is it for a specific problem at hand?
And having this framework will help you navigate those.
