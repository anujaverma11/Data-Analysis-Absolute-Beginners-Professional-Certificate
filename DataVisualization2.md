#### Business Visualizations
Businesses live and breath by communicating data visualizations all the time. Here at Microsoft not a day goes by without various reports, scorecards, and charts flying through email and presentations to communicate business status and other information. In this lesson you'll start to see how to create these visualizations for business use.

#### Overview of Business Visualizations
You may see visualizations around you for personal use like health monitoring or the current status of your car, or the location of your train. Visualizations in a business context can be extremely useful in communicating complex information in simple and efficient ways. In this lesson we're going to look at the importance of visualizations in business, and a few simple ways they are used.


>> When we do visualization of business there are really
four artifacts that we end up
creating as data visualization experts.
And that is number one, dashboards.
And when you think of dashboards you may immediately
go to maybe the dashboard in your car.
And that's to show you an aggregate
of information like is my car healthy?
How fast am I going?
And how many miles do I have left in my tank of gas?
And all that stuff can be accessed in that one portal,
and that's the idea of dashboards is
that you can run your business out of a dashboard.
The next one, scorecards is maybe even
more specific to performance.
For these key metrics,
how am I doing? Red, yellow, green?
Is there something I need to be aware of
right now? Something flashing at me?
There's a lot's of different ways that you can scorecard,
but it's all to do with performance.
And those are used to track things like in business,
your revenue targets
your customer satisfaction, and all that.
And I think can be used inside of a dashboard.
Next, maybe in less complex scenarios
you basically do an analytic report.
And the idea is that you create this report as
visualization that business users will
access maybe more than
once and it refreshes with live data,
but it doesn't have to be this one stop shop
of everything happening in the business.
And last but not least for sure,
are just basic analysis.
When you're creating an analysis for a problem at hand,
and that might be a one-off and that's okay,
and that's necessary for
the thing that you're working on.
And that might be,
let's figure out how we're doing on sales today,
or in other example in business,
let's figure out where our customer's pain points
are and then from that analysis we could then
take some specific action in
our business to change behavior to drive results.
