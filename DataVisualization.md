## Data Visualization: A Practical Approach for Absolute Beginners

#### Visualizations are Everywhere
If you look around at any point during a normal day, you can see data visualizations all around you. 
The battery indicator on a mobile phone is a great example. The spedometer in a car is another way to visualize the 
speed of a vehical beyond just a numeric value.

Visualizations provide a different way for your brain to process the data in a way that utilizes visual recognition 
- something our human brains are optimized for.
We're going to start this course by looking at differnt visualizations around us and 
how they are a natural part of how we process information. We'll then introduce simple visualizations we can create 
to help translate data into tools for insight generation.

##### Four pillars
 1. Analyze data.
  - Using Visualizations to gain insight
    - Understanding - So we analyze data, we try to understand data,
2. Communicate it out
  - Passing a message to others
    - Connection - We have to connect the abstract world of data with the real stuff of life.
3. Monitoring
 - tracking information about performance - For e.g. we have a lot of servers that require uptime and in those servers, we want to make sure that everything's ticking along.
  
4. Planning
  - forecast or predict or potentially preempt any negative outcomes
  - Forsight
  
  
When we get into making data visualizations you'll see that what we're trying to do is we're trying to make a sum of
all the little parts and points of data that we will compile. And that's to make it delicious for users,
make it delicious and exciting for yourself.
And much like assembling a burger, what we'll find is these individual little points or these moments in time or
these customers or these partners or these purchases, all these things come together into a single whole that excites end users,
that makes it interesting and understandable by others.
