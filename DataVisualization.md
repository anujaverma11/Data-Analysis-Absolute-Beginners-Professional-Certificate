##Data Visualization: A Practical Approach for Absolute Beginners

#### Visualizations are Everywhere
If you look around at any point during a normal day, you can see data visualizations all around you. 
The battery indicator on a mobile phone is a great example. The spedometer in a car is another way to visualize the 
speed of a vehical beyond just a numeric value.

Visualizations provide a different way for your brain to process the data in a way that utilizes visual recognition 
- something our human brains are optimized for.
We're going to start this course by looking at differnt visualizations around us and 
how they are a natural part of how we process information. We'll then introduce simple visualizations we can create 
to help translate data into tools for insight generation.

##### Four pillars
 1. Analyze data.
  - Using Visualizations to gain insight
    - Understanding - So we analyze data, we try to understand data,
2. Communicate it out
  - Passing a message to others
So, you want to build
these visualizations to package them
up and have them be useful and consumable by people,

perhaps your boss, consumable,
perhaps by a significant other
or your friend who you're trying to say,
"Hey look at my gaming stats today.
They're pretty awesome, right?"
And it can be as simple as that.
And that's so that we can connect.
We have to connect the abstract world of
data with the real stuff of life.
And number three is monitoring.
So, we also want to understand
and steward businesses as they go along, right?
So, perhaps we have a lot of servers that
require uptime and in those servers,
we want to make sure that everything's ticking along.
So we have perhaps visualisations to help us interpret
and make sure that we're doing our job properly,
we're serving our customers by having accessible services
and that's oftentimes where
you'll see monitoring is more on the IT side.
And then lastly, it's planning.
So we want to be able to
forecast or predict or potentially
preempt any negative outcomes
that could come from not looking at data itself.
So data can tell us a whole bunch
of things because data is
just an abstraction of reality
and we want to know what's
happening in our business, and our life.
We have to visualize data.
