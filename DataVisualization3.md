###   Visualizations of Tomorrow
### Advanced Visualizations

There is a whole world of data visualizations beyond what we're going to cover in this course, and new intersting ones that show up every day. We'll look at a few advanced visualizations in this lesson to whet your appetite for exploring the world of visualizations beyond this material.

#### Butterfly Charts
tart of transcript. Skip to the end.
We've come a long way from bar charts,
column charts, and pie charts.
And now we'll talk about Advanced Visualizations.
And while they'll get complex,
really what you've learned forms the basis of
these more advanced visualizations and chart types.
So, let's dig into Butterfly Diagrams.
And my friend actually invented these.
So, these are charts that are meant to
portray five different dimensions of
data on the same chart.
And what we'll see
here is something you've already had a glimpse at,
which was the heat map of those items on left there.
And tacked onto it,
to make it a Combo chart are
these different chart additions.
So, on the right you see
the bar chart going
down and is an aggregation of those values on the left.
And in the bottom you
see a Column chart that's flipped upside down,
and it's an aggregation of
the columns of each of those values.
And so, it's allowing you to see
multi-dimensional data on a two dimensional plane
and interpreting kind of,
understand and tease out patterns that you might see.
So, in this case we see that there's
two kind of anomalies.
If we mess around with the calculations a little bit,
can we see something different?
And it allows you to kind of dig in
just that much farther.
But the amount of extra time
and resources spent to create these advanced chart types,
there's something you always have to ask yourself,
is it worth it?
Well, I have to explain what this thing is like we
just did with this advanced chart type.
But it's very cool. It's something that you're
totally capable of building right now,
and something that we actually will build in our lab.
