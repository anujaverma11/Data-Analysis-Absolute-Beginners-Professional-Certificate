###   Visualizations of Tomorrow
### Advanced Visualizations

There is a whole world of data visualizations beyond what we're going to cover in this course, and new intersting ones that show up every day. We'll look at a few advanced visualizations in this lesson to whet your appetite for exploring the world of visualizations beyond this material.

We've come a long way from bar charts, column charts, and pie charts. And now we'll talk about Advanced Visualizations. And while they'll get complex, really what you've learned forms the basis of these more advanced visualizations and chart types. 

#### Butterfly Charts
Butterfly Diagrams - these are charts that are meant to portray five different dimensions of data on the same chart. And what we'll see here is something you've already had a glimpse at, which was the heat map of those items on left there. And tacked onto it, to make it a Combo chart are these different chart additions. So, on the right you see the bar chart going down and is an aggregation of those values on the left. And in the bottom you see a Column chart that's flipped upside down, and it's an aggregation of the columns of each of those values. And so, it's allowing you to see multi-dimensional data on a two dimensional plane and interpreting kind of, understand and tease out patterns that you might see. So, in this case we see that there's two kind of anomalies. If we mess around with the calculations a little bit, can we see something different? And it allows you to kind of dig in just that much farther. But the amount of extra time and resources spent to create these advanced chart types, there's something you always have to ask yourself, is it worth it? Well, I have to explain what this thing is like we just did with this advanced chart type. But it's very cool. It's something that you're totally capable of building right now, and something that we actually will build in our lab.

#### Other Advanced Charts
Beyond our butterfly diagram, there are many different advanced chart types that you could learn.
And I'd like to give you a run through of just a number of them that you can check out. And we'll provide more context.
But the idea is to just give you a glimpse of what's possible.

##### Stream graphs.
The idea behind them is that you release the bottom axis and let the data kind of flow through the chart.
And why you don't see them often in the world, they are very neat, they are a more advanced way of doing time series graphs.

##### Marimekko charts. 
They're kind of crazy. And are a mix of treemap and all that's part of a whole analysis and calculations and I don't see them used very often. And they're much more useful when you unpack them into bar charts and column charts, link below.

##### Sankey diagrams.
They show throughput. So, the idea is you start with one state and then flow through to an end state. An example of that is perhaps like, sticking water down your faucet. So, if you took a big jug of water and just dumped it into the faucet, it would go through some pipes, then maybe go through some other pipes, and it would end up at some final state in maybe multiple locations or one, who knows? But the idea is that throughput will be potentially diagrammed or could be diagrammed on a sankey diagram. Because it has a beginning, and middle process, and an end process. And that's what they're useful for.

##### Candlestick Chart
And then another one I like is candlestick charts. So, what's cool about them is they have a lot packed into these little boxes here, with a kind of distributions at the end. And well will see the most often is in stock analysis. So, in stocks you have kind of when the stock price is opened and when it closed. And the bigger it is, means it has a higher kind of threshold of when it started and when it closed. The smaller it is, means that the distribution of the data is more tightly packed. So, there's a lot of information in these little candlesticks but they're a lot of fun. So they can be useful in specific contexts. 

##### Funnel charts
Then lastly, we have our funnel charts. So, funnel charts are like bar charts. But the idea is that there is some kind of fallout at each stage of the funnel chart. So you start out with a certain population and this kind of instance is about sales. Right? So, the idea is you proposed a bunch of sales things to your audience and you only end up closing a number of them. So, these various sales stages there is fallout. Like a person and click on your advertisement, person into followup with your phone call. But finally, the number that you actually did close from the people that you reached out, is the end state of that funnel chart.
