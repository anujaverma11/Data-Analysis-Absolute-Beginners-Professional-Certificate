### Course Overview

This course has six modules.

1. Introduction to Data and Variables: In this module, you'll look at different types of data, unpack variables as a concept, 
and explore the implications these have for how we look at data in business and in the world at large. You'll also learn 
the basics of mathematical notation that pertains to data analysis.

2. Summarizing Data with Distributions and Graphs: In this module, you'll leverage common visualization techniques such as 
histograms, pie charts, bar graphs, etc., and the underlying tables that go with them in order to understand the essential 
measurements and math behind distributions. Additional topics covered include skewness and various kinds of non-normality.

3. Summary Statistics: In this module, you'll learn to identify the right summary statistic for variables. You'll also learn 
how to compute those summary statistics using both stock Excel functions and nesting basic Excel functions. Topics covered 
include mode, mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile range, proportions, and crosstabs.

4. Business Statistics: In this module, you'll learn about KPIs (key performance indicators) in a business context, as well as 
the different types of KPI you might see from business, financial, sales, marketing, and IT analysts.

5. Introduction to Inferential Math and Forecasting: In this module, you'll explore and apply the principles of inferential 
statistics. You'll also be introduced to the basics of forecasting in Excel for data analysis.

6. Final Exam and Challenge Labs: At the very end of the course, you'll take a 30-question, multiple-choice Final Exam and 
complete two Challenge Labs.


### Introduction
There are two main goals for this course. Now, in many ways data analysis and statistics can be taught in sort of a cookie cutter fashion, where you don't really understand what you're doing, you just do it You just kinda plug and play some things together. You don't really know what's going on. That is not my goal for you in this course. I am hoping that you will come out of this course with some actual understanding, not just how to do things, but what they mean and why, so you begin to build that reasoning and that skill set that you could apply in many contexts. But in addition to that, I also want you to be able to use it. I want you to be able to use some basic statistical tools, I want you to be able to implement those in a program like Excel, so that you can actually do the nuts and bolts of data analysis. And then, of course, this will give you a foundation not only for doing statistics and data work, but also give you a base to build on so that you can take other courses and build your skills further. So this is what we're going to do in this course. We're going to learn some basics of data analysis, you're going to learn how to use it, and you're going to be able to have a foundation to learn more, so I hope you're excited, as I am.
