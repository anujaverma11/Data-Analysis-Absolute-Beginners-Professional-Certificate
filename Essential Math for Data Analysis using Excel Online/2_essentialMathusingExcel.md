#### Histogram

Histogram is the single most useful graph you'll ever make in data analysis. It's one graph to represent one variable. 

> Imagine I've got data on the number of cups of coffee a number of people consume in a day. Here I've got that data on the screen. If I wanted to understand this data I could eyeball the data, I could just kinda look at it, try to draw some insights. It's pretty confusing and laborious. It looks like I've got a bunch of ones, but I would have to really effortfully think about this and imagine if I had 1,000 rows or 10,000 rows. It's just no doable. In a histogram I simply make a graph of these numbers. I have all of the different numbers of cups of coffee plotted on the X axis and then the height of the bar tells you how many people have that score. For instance, you can easily see in this graph that one is the most common number consumed. Most people in this dataset consume one cup of coffee. Then two is the second most common score and you see that represented in the bar as the second highest bar. So it is really just an easy way to visualize where all the scores are and in fact this contains all the information. It tells me how many scores I have of each number. 

It's just sorted and visualized in a way that's easy to read. One feature about histograms that is useful which I haven't shown you here, but you'll get to see in the labs, if you've got a large range on that X axis sometimes we won't make them individual numbers but groups. Like I might have a range from say zero to two and then a range from two to four to represent those bars. Just makes it a little easier if I've got a large range of levels for my X axis, but we'll get into that in the labs. Either way it is the most useful graph you'll ever make to quickly look at what your variable is doing without any calculation necessary.
